# ArduinoStopLight

##### Provides incoming object detection functionality through an Ultrasound sensor. Implements object detection and calculates it's displacement vector to determine if the object is approaching the sensor. Once approaching, the program illuminates an LED strip to display the relative safe distance to the sensor (green, yellow, red).

Example of a real world application would be for a garage, when having to park a car in a tight space.
